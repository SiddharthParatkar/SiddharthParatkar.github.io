							<p>
								I'm a current Information Systems and Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University with a minor in Computational Finance.
								I will be graduating in May of 2023, and as of the writing of this sentence I'm pursuing internships for the Summer of 2022.
								<br><br>I have strong proficiency in Java, ReactJS, SQL and Ruby on Rails for programming languages, and I am also very proficient in Linux and GitHub as technologies.
								Additionally, I have worked with Python, VueJS, C, React Native and Spring Boot and have moderate proficiency in all of these languages.
								<br><br>I currently work as a Software Engineering Intern in the Software Engineer Program at JPMorgan Chase, where I'm working on developing the Omni Request Tool dashboard
								in Angular, TypeScript, MySQL and Spring Boot. Additionally, I am working over the summer as a TA for 15-150, Principles of Functional Programming, designing lecture plans and
								contributing to existing course materials on GitHub. If you want to learn more about them, please follow the link <a href="#experiences">here</a>.
								<br><br>I currently do not have any personal projects in the works, but this will change in the coming months so this section should be changed very soon. In general, though, the majority
								of my project-based experience has been in frontend development, although I certainly want to branch out and learn more about backend and ML/AI work in the future.
								<br><br>In my spare time, outside of work and coding, I enjoy playing tennis (along with all the other racquet sports and volleyball), following the ATP Tour and the NBA, playing chess poorly and 
								taking photographs of Carnegie Mellon's campus as well as other locations I find enjoyable. You can see my favorite photo I've taken ever as the background for this website,
								but all of the other photos in the other cards will also be photos I have taken myself. I don't consider myself a professional photographer, but I love being able to capture
								the wonder of our planet, or at least the limited view I have of it.
								<br><br>If you want to contact me for any reason, you can find my email, LinkedIn and GitHub <a href="#contact">here</a>. Thank you again for visiting my website!

										<strong>SDE Intern @ Amazon AWS</strong>
										<br><i>May 2022 - August 2022</i>
										<br><br>The project that I was assigned to this summer was to enhance the MQTT Test Client. 
										Firstly, I had to fix two bugs present in the client. The first bug was an issue with the 
										client failing to reconnect after a period of time; after determining that the issue was most 
										probably the possible chance that the keepalive timer of 5 minutes and the session ID expiry 
										of 5 minutes could intersect and cause an expiry before the keepalive check happened, I 
										updated both the keepalive time and the reconnecting time to ensure that the client would 
										always be active while the tab was being used. The second bug turned out to be user error 
										of sending various data through the test client, but working on the bug helped me understand 
										how to send data properly through the client.

										<br><br>My main feature was working on constructing a payload that would save its own state 
										in the Redux data store and be associated with each topic that can be subscribed to within 
										the test client. To do this, I spent some time figuring out the architecture of the test 
										client, which helped me work with the UX team to design a payload. Then, for my implementation, 
										I updated the existing interfaces to add fields that could store the information necessary, 
										and in the parts of the test client that allowed for changes to be made to the payload, I 
										added checks and dispatches to ensure the information in the store would always be up to date. 
										This also involved changing the publishing flow of messages to the test client. I was able 
										to finish my project by thoroughly testing each component I made and presenting to the rest 
										of the AWS IoT.

										<strong>15-213 Head TA @ CMU CS</strong>
										<br><i>December 2021 - August 2022</i>
										<br><br>15-213, Introduction to Computer Systems, is a class that builds on previous exposure to C 
										and teaches students about the underpinnings of modern computer systems, such as caching, handling 
										memory, bitwise operations, multi-threading and more. At the end of this summer, I will have TAed 15-213 for two consecutive semesters, one of those semesters (Summer 2022) as the Head TA.

										<br><br>My responsibilities as TA include constructing weekly lesson plans for hour-long lab sessions where students work through lab problems and are taught the above topics
										Also, I hold 4 hours minimum of weekly office hours to help students work through challenging problems and conceptual questions, as well as grade student code for style points.
										Finally, I work on written and lab assignments throughout the semester to continually update course materials for current and future semesters.
										
										<br><br>As a Head TA for the Summer of 2022, I worked with the professors of the course to maintain course standards, coordinate weekly staff meetings, following up with Lead TAs on their parts of the course and making sure that the course runs smoothly.

										<strong>SWE Intern @ JPMorgan Chase</strong>
										<br><i>June 2021 - August 2021</i>
										<br><br>The project for my internship is to work on a client-facing dashboard in an Agile environment, 
										and I began by designing widget appearance and working with the client and the remainder of the full-time 
										team to determine optimal use cases for various tasks requested. I then used Angular, Typescript and Bootstrap 
										to implement a static top bar along with minimization and expanding features for each widget, along with deletion 
										functionalities. Then, I was given responsibility over the Tasks widget, where I used RESTful APIs developed in Java Spring Boot to grab data 
										from the MySQL tasks database and filter that data to only display tasks within specific buckets of time, and 
										also dynamically updated the buckets when the application is restarted to display the number of tasks per bucket 
										in the bucket headers. Finally, I worked on deploying the application using a Jenkins wrapper to the cloud.
										<br><br>
										At the end of this internship, my team presented to executive directors at JPMorgan Chase, which decided that our presentation was a Top 2 Presentation among 31 teams from our location.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>15-150 TA @ CMU CS</strong>
										<br><i>December 2020 - August 2021</i>
										<br><br>
										15-150, Principles of Functional Programming, is a class that uses the language SML and emphasizes recursive thinking, with applications in academia and web development. 
										At the end of this summer, I will have TAed 15-150 (Principles of Functional Programming) for two consecutive semesters. 
										
										<br><br>As a Teaching Assistant, I
										develop weekly lesson plans and teach 90 minute labs on the topics of Functional Programming that are taught, which have a wide range of uses in both
										academia and conventional industry languages. These topics include Higher Order Functions, Continuation Passing Style and Induction. In addition to this, 
										I have contributed to the GitHub repositories for course material, including updating homeworks and labs in LaTeX and playtesting existing homeworks. Finally,
										I hold weekly office hours for 3 hours to allow students to ask conceptual and homework questions on the topics of that week.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Research Assistant @ CMU's Human-Computer Interaction Institute</strong>
										<br><i>September 2020 - December 2020</i>
										<br><br>
										In this role, I used Vue, HTML, CSS and Lumilo detectors to create and design an in-depth dashboard that analyzed and displayed information about students doing problem sets in a dashboard for teachers. The detectors allowed teachers to see the most recent problem that the students had worked on, as well as the progress made throughout a given problem set. 

										The deep dive of this dashboard that I worked on allows teachers to see the amount of time students have taken on a problem set, along with the number of problems completed, correct without hints, correct with hints, and incorrect problems. The teachers can also see the students' progress throughout all of the problem sets so far.

										<a href="https://github.com/SiddharthParatkar/TartanHacks" target="_blank"><strong>StudySmart</strong></a>
										<br><i>February 2020</i><br><br>
										StudySmart was created for TartanHacks 2020. It uses Microsoft Azure, Kismet API, 2 Raspberry Pis, JVectorMap, HTML, CSS and JS. For the project, we used the Pis and Kismet to packet-sniff the routers on campus and display data of how crowded a room is. This data was logged and displayed on a map using JVectorMap, which takes in an SVG file (Scalable Vector Graphics) and outputs an HTML-compatible map. This map, along with the data, was shown on a website using Microsoft Azure.

										This project was a Top 6 competitor at TartanHacks 2020 and won Best Beginner Hack by BNY Mellon.

										<strong>Ohio Humanities Website</strong>
										<br><i>October 2020</i><br><br>In this hackathon project for Code for Good 2020, we were tasked with creating an interactive website for the nonprofit Ohio Humanities that would allow them to reach more people of various ages. In order to do this, I used NodeJS to display user reactions to messages and comments underneath content released by Ohio Humanities, as well as allowing them to see data gathered from their users in charts via ChartsJS. These features were tested with dummy data generated and used via SQLite. We placed second with this project in our division for CFG 2020.

										<a href="https://github.com/SiddharthParatkar/CourseMate" target="_blank"><strong>CourseMate</strong></a>
										<br><i>July 2020 - August 2020</i><br><br>
										This app was made in response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially as students will be transitioning to remote learning for at least a full semester and freshmen won't be able to have as many interactive experiences on campus as before. This app allows students to connect with other people in their lectures and recitations, and reach out to those students to either rekindle old friendships that may have died out over time, or to develop new connections with students going through the same experience as you.

										This app was made with React Native and tested with Expo. I utilized Adobe Illustrator to create the logo of the app, which can be seen on the login and signup pages, and we used Firebase to store user information. This project was completed in August 2020.
